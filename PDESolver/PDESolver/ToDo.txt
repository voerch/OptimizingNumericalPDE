cash-flushes: When you ask for a piece of data from memory, as getting stuff from memory is slow but can be vectorised, a whole load of consecutive values are copied from RAM into the cache. This means that if you are doing a matrix operation that uses the first column of values, then the second etc. It is much better to store these values in memory as column 1, then column 2 etc. If you save it as Row1, Row 2 etc, then every time you access a new element the CPU will have to flush the cache: delete all its values and again load a set of consecutive values from memory. The differences can be very big. So you should have a look at how you implement the ADI method and decide whether the way the calculations are done, it is much better to have the arrays stored by a list of columns or of rows. And it could be (but I have not checked this, so this is just an optimistic dream) that ArrayOld and ArrayNew need different storage. If this were to be so then this would be a quite interesting discovery.
