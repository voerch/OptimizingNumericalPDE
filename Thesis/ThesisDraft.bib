abstract="Before we delve into the depths of finance, discussing the alpha and beta strategies which are the primary subject of this chapter, we digress to the olive. Why olives? As we noted in Chapter 1 and numerous times since, it was in the olive market that Thales did the first recorded option trade. Hence, it seems like an appropriate place to start our story. Greek cuisine has become very popular worldwide. If there is a food which seems to embody Greece and its cuisine, it would likely be the olive. The very slightly bitter taste of the olive is incredibly distinctive, and a flavor which is instantly memorable. For those who have grown up surrounded by olives, it is a taste which reminds them of home. For the rest of us, it is a taste which whispers to us from the shores of the Mediterranean.",

author = "Robert C. Merton",
abstract = "The validity of the classic Black-Scholes option pricing formula depends on the capability of investors to follow a dynamic portfolio strategy in the stock that replicates the payoff structure to the option. The critical assumption required for such a strategy to be feasible, is that the underlying stock return dynamics can be described by a stochastic process with a continuous sample path. In this paper, an option pricing formula is derived for the more-general case when the underlying stock returns are generated by a mixture of both continuous and jump processes. The derived formula has most of the attractive features of the original Black-Scholes formula in that it does not depend on investor preferences or knowledge of the expected return on the underlying stock. Moreover, the same analysis applied to the options can be extended to the pricing of corporate liabilities."
