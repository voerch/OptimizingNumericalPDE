Operator splitting is a natural and old idea. When a PDE or system of PDEs contains different terms expressing different physics, it is natural to use different numerical methods for different physical processes. This can optimize and simplify the overall solution process. The idea was especially popularized in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations and reaction-diffusion PDEs. Common names for the technique are operator splitting, fractional step methods, and split-step methods. We shall stick to the former name. In the context of nonlinear differential equations, operator splitting can be used to isolate nonlinear terms and simplify the solution methods.

A related technique, often known as dimensional splitting or alternating direction implicit (ADI) methods, is to split the spatial dimensions and solve a 2D or 3D problem as two or three consecutive 1D problems, but this type of splitting is not to be further considered here.
